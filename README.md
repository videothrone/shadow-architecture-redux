# Shadow Architecture (Redux)

This project is a work-in-progress rebuild of the original [Shadow Architecture](https://github.com/videothrone/shadow-architecture) project I did at [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/) with React and TypeScript using Vite. The original code was so old it couldn't even be hosted, so I've decided to refactor it, but keep the original idea and design (for now).
