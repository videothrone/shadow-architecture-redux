# Shadow Architecture (Redux)

This project is a work-in-progress rebuild of the original [Shadow Architecture](https://github.com/videothrone/shadow-architecture) project I did at [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/) with React and TypeScript using Vite. The original code was so old it couldn't even be hosted, so I've decided to refactor it, but keep the general idea and the design aesthetics. The content data of the places themselves is probably outdated and will be updated at the end of the process.

## Local Setup

Install NPM packages:
```bash
npm i
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
